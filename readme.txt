== Description ==
Click fraud happens when someone who does not intend to do business with you (a competitor, a person or a bot) clicks on your paid ads to waste your ad budget. Web scraping is automated extraction and collection of data (eg: email addresses, catalog info) from your website and is exported/sold to various third parties (like spammers and competitors).  Bluefield Identity prevents click fraud and web scraping with the most effective service in the industry.  Our service keeps your ads safe and your content secure.  

Quick and easy installation provides immediate real-time protection for ALL your siteâ€™s incoming traffic.  

#### What does the Bluefield Identity WordPress Plugin do?

Unlike other ad fraud solutions: 

* Bluefield Identity works on your website and not via access to your paid ads campaign.  

* Bluefield Identity protects ALL paid traffic sources, not just Google, Facebook and Microsoft.  

* Unlike other fraud solutions, Bluefield Identity works against organic and direct traffic to prevent web scraping, form stuffing, inventory hoarding and other detrimental actions.

Our service screens EVERY page request on your site for every visitor delivering a pass/fail recommendation before anything else happens on your site.  Fails for paid clicks ensure the advertiser doesn't receive arrival confirmation for the click thereby preserving your ad budget.  Bluefield Identity vets your incoming traffic reserving your ad budgets for clicks from visitors more likely to convert.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

* Is there a free trial?
Partnership with Bluefield Identity has no contracts.  When you receive the invoice and accompanying performance details and summary at the end of each month, YOU choose whether to pay the invoice or not.  If Bluefield Identity isn't right for your business, don't pay the invoice and, within a few days, we will deactivate your Bluefield Identity account with no questions asked and no further collection efforts.  If you choose to come back, simply pay the unpaid invoice amount and your account is reactivated automatically.  Try and use the service first and if it doesn't work for you, don't pay.
