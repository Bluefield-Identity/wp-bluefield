== Description ==
JunkShun is a click fraud prevention web service that works directly on your website to screen every incoming click and lets you define the visitor pool you want your ads recorded from. Visitors who fail our filters never register their arrival with the ad platforms - so your ad budget isn't charged.

Unlike other click fraud solutions, JunkShun lets you block not only fraudulent traffic but also visitors you consider undesirable - configure whitelists, blacklists, geofencing by country, state or radius, customized rate limits, VPN and proxy blocking, and more. Traffic that ad platforms would consider legitimate but that you'd rather not pay for. And because JunkShun works on your website, it protects all paid traffic sources - not just Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.

Using automated bid strategies? JunkShun gives your campaigns cleaner data to learn from - meaning less wasted ad spend during the learning phase.

#### Frequently Asked Questions
* Will this block legitimate customers?
Our filter system is designed to identify patterns that legitimate visitors don't exhibit. You have full control over multiple filters to ensure they match your business needs. Plus, you can whitelist any IP addresses you want to always allow through.

* Do I need technical knowledge to use JunkShun?
Not at all. Our interface is designed for marketers and business owners, not developers. If you can use Google Ads, you can use JunkShun. Plus, our default settings work great for most businesses.

* How quickly can I get started?
Setup takes less than 5 minutes. As soon as you configure your filters, JunkShun starts protecting your campaigns immediately. Most users see fraudulent clicks being blocked within the first hour.

* What happens after the free month?
We'll send you a detailed click report showing exactly how many fraudulent clicks we blocked, both paid and organic. You'll also receive an invoice with 14 days to pay. If you're not convinced, simply don't pay and your account will be suspended. No hassles, no hidden charges.

* Will your plugin slow down my website?
No. The JunkShun service is designed to provide the fastest response possible (average response time is 12 milliseconds) and is hosted on a robust cloud network guaranteeing the quickest routing possible.
