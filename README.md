# Bluefield Identity plugin for WordPress


Prevent click fraud/site scraping using Bluefield Identity's WordPress plugin.

## Description

Click fraud happens when someone who never intends to do business with you (a competitor, a person or a bot) clicks on your paid ads and wastes your ad budget.

Web scraping is automated extraction and collection of data (think: email addresses and catalog info) from a website which is then exported to various third parties (like spammers and competitors).

Bluefield Identity helps to prevent click fraud and web scraping with the most effective service in the industry keeping your ads safe and your content secure.  Quick and easy installation provides immediate real-time protection for all your site’s incoming traffic.

### What does the Bluefield Identity WordPress Plugin offer?

Our service screens every page request on your site for every visitor.  We work with ALL paid traffic advertisers (Google, Microsoft, Meta Facebook/Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, Reddit, Yahoo, etc) as well as all organic (non paid) traffic.  For every visitor page request, the plugin delivers a pass or fail recommendation before anything else happens on your site.  Fails for paid clicks ensure the advertiser shouldn’t charge you for the click thereby preserving your ad budget for visitors who are more likely to do business with you.

### What does Bluefield screen out?

Bluefield Identity shields client sites from traffic that likely has no genuine intent of doing business with your website. Our filter targets and counters clicks from:

* Bad actors - Bots, frequent ad click visitors/abusers, competitors clicking your ads to deplete your ad budget, spam web forms, scrape content, surveil, or conduct other malicious tasks.

* Flagged visitors - Bluefield Identity maintains an extensive database of actors known for web misconduct. If these flagged visitors have previously triggered our filters for other clients and have received a temporary “timeout”, they're likely not on your website with genuine intentions. We act accordingly.

* Geofenced Visitors - Visitors outside your defined operational regions remain a significant source of superfluous ad spend. Bluefield Identity's WordPress plugin addresses this issue  ensuring you don't expend funds on users beyond your designated zones.

* Multiple Layers of Protection - Bluefield Identity currently applies 17 distinct filters, designed to counteract click fraud and thwart dodgy organic traffic. We work with our clients to identify emerging trends and we constantly refine our filters to provide best in class protection.
